## Undefined / Null 
Undefined usually come out when nothing can be returned. 
Through 'console.log' on the prompt, It can make something to print out, but result
does not have anything.

Undefined is data type, string

Undefined is not equal to false.

console.log('Hello, Undefined!');
-> Hello, Undefined!

typeof undefined;
-> undefined

!!undefined;
-> false



Null is empty quote, but different with string

undefined === null;
-> false

!!null;
-> false

null == false;
-> false

## famous bug on javascript
typeof null;
-> object
